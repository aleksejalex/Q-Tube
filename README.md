# Q-Tube
(read as smth in between "YouTube" and "Cute Tube")

## Few words about...
### YouTube video downloader with GUI written in Qt6
Desktop app built in Python using [pytube](https://pytube.io) and [PySide6 (Qt6)](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/quickstart.html)

The purpose of this project is to develop a very simple (both simple to use and simple to read the source code) Python app, which can show and download (in the best quality available) YouTube videos based on the link provided.

### Pleasant side features:
 - no tracking of user's activity (except for what is built-in in YouTube OFC)
 - no commercials shown
 - deployed `.exe` file can run on Windows *without installation* (no Python or any libraries required)
 - GUI looks good *both* on Windows and Linux (thanks to Qt6)
 
## How to run?
Run Python script `qtube.py` in directory `source`. Be sure you have installed all libraries from `requirements.txt`.

On Windows, you can run `.exe` file without any installation (for download in [Release section of repo](https://github.com/aleksejalex/Q-Tube/tags)).
