# Q-Tube
(read as smth in between of "YouTube" and "Cute Tube")

By [@aleksejalex](https://github.com/aleksejalex)

### YouTube video downloader with GUI written in Qt6
Desktop app built in Python using [pytube](https://pytube.io) and [PySide6 (Qt6)](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/quickstart.html)

### Few words about...
The purpose of this project is to develop very simple (both simple to use and simple to read the source code) Python app, which can show and download (in best quality available) YouTube videos based on link provided.

### Pleasant side features:
 - no tracking of user's activity (except of what is built-in in YouTube OFC)
 - no commercials shown
 - deployed '.exe' file can run on Windows *without installation* (no Python or any libraries required)
 - GUI looks good *both* on Windows and Linux (thanks to Qt6)
